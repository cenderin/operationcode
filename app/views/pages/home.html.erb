              <p>Learning to code and join an American software company can be daunting if your entire career has been serving our country. Our Software Mentor Protégé Program gets veterans coding through both 1-on-1 software mentorship as well as our Peer-to-Peer community. Our vetted software developers are experts in their craft and help our veterans debug their code quicker so they can keep coding, join the ranks as software developers and begin making invaluable open source software contributions today.</p>

              <p>The men and women of our Armed Forces have already proven themselves on and off the battlefield with their leadership, tenacity, navigating complex situations, and managing teams to mission success. Hiring veterans is not only a smart investment in your company, but as an Employer Partner we help deepen the pool of diverse applicants who not only bring these soft skills to the table, but can also code.</p>
